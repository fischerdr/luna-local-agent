# Backends

LM Studio, llama.cpp built here and kokoro-reader are the installer's
own. Any other place her model or voice can run (containers, a GPU
server on the network) is a folder of its own, `backends/<name>/`, with
a `backend.py`. Drop it in and the installer offers it; delete it and
it's gone. Nothing else names it. That's the same idea as `plugins/`, but
for the installer and the launcher: Luna herself never loads a backend,
and only talks to the URLs it set up, as she does with LM Studio's.

Every hook is an optional function in `backend.py`:

| Hook | Called | For |
|---|---|---|
| `add_args(ap)` | building the installer's flags | flags of its own |
| `validate(inst, args)` → `(errors, notes)` | before anything runs | its flags against the others |
| `check_system(inst)` | "Checking this machine" | a line about what it needs |
| `backends(inst)` → `[{key, label, menu, default, local_model}]` | `--backend`, and the model-server question | the model servers it offers |
| `backend(inst, state, key)` | one of them is picked | setting it up |
| `gpu_reserve(inst, state)` → GB | picking her model | graphics memory kept for what shares the GPU |
| `model(inst, state, pick)` | after the model pick (`pick` is None if `local_model` is false) | where its backend gets the model |
| `voices(inst)` → `[{key, label, default}]` | `--voice`, and the voice question | the voices it offers |
| `voice(inst, state, key)` | one of them is picked | setting it up |
| `voice_failed(inst, state)` → bool | kokoro-reader's packages didn't install | offering its voice instead |
| `install(inst, state)` | after her model | the rest of its setup |
| `health(inst, state)` | the health check | its own lines |
| `start(settings)` → `{handled, stop}` | `launch.py`, before her | starting its servers; the launcher doesn't start what it handled (`"chat"`, `"tts"`), and calls `stop()` when she exits |

`inst` is the installer, for its flags (`inst.ARGS`) and its helpers
(`step`, `ok`, `warn`, `ask`, `choose`, `run`, `note`, `set_config`).
`installer/install.sh` also sources a `backends/<name>/python.sh`, if there
is one, when it finds no Python 3.10-3.13: it may set `PY` to a newer one
when its backend brings what the older one was needed for.

A backend that fails to import, or whose `start()` raises, is reported
and skipped, so it can't stop Luna from installing or starting.
`backend.py` should import only the standard library at the top.
`tests/test_backends.py` has a pretend one that uses every hook.

# Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests     # from the repo folder; no model, UI or network needed
```

`tests/test_turn_safety.py` covers the rules that hang off a turn
(`turnctx.py`): a turn's passes end with it and never reach another
thread; outside content marks only its own turn; web requests ask once
files and outside content mix; a job writes only in `job_write_dirs`;
allow-all and Discord auto-approve step aside for outside content; the
deny list; a narrow turn (stream chat) can't attach tools outside its
list, and routing state never outlives its turn. One test runs a whole
stream-chat turn through `llm.ask` against a fake model server.

`tests/test_interrupts.py` covers stopping her (`interrupts.py`): a HOME
pressed while a turn waits for the last one still lands; a stop never
reaches the next turn and nothing clears anyone else's; HOME stops your
own turn entirely and only silences the rest; a stop wakes a waiting
loop at once; a stopped turn makes no new request to the model.

`tests/test_shared_state.py` races real threads at the state several of
them share: walking away (two appraisals finishing together walk her out
once), the on-screen conversation (painting while messages come and go),
and the microphone count PortAudio restarts check. It also checks the ui
package's public names.

`tests/test_config.py` checks the config package: every live setting has
its constant, `BASE_DIR` is the repo, and `/set` and plugin switches change
the value everyone reads (against a temporary config.json).

`tests/offline.py` keeps every test away from real servers; import it
first in a new test file.

Run them after touching tools, the turn code, the permission checks or
anything that stops her.

# Extras

```bash
python3 kokoro-say.py                 # read the clipboard aloud through
                                      # the TTS server - bind it to a key
```
